        <p class ="description">My name is Todd Johnston. I am from Gilbert Arizona.  I grew up in a family of 8.  I was on the swim team, played the Upright Bass in the Schools Orchesta, and took various coding classes, dipping my toes into programming as a while.  After graduating I applied for Brigham Young University, and got in, initially majoring in Mechanichal Engineering.</p>

        <p class ="description">After graduating I applied for Brigham Young University, and got in, initially majoring in Mechanichal Engineering.  Soon after attending I found my love for computers, and programming and switched my Major to computer Engineering.  I have grown to love the ability to disign and create anything I would like, whithin the limits of my own ability.  This has prompted me to improve my own personal ability, and take on challenges that expand my own limits.</p>
        <p class ="description">While at BYU I met my Current fiance, and future wife (as seen above).  She is amazing, and I am immensily luck to have her.  I have a gecko, and a fish, Spaz and Santiago, and am currently learning how to cook.</p>
        <p class ="description">Overall I am looking to truly break into a carreen in Development and think my drive for success would be a tremendous asset for any company. I am committed to learning more every day.</p>
